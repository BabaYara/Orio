CHiLL expansion for ORIO

Files:

	Orio/orio/module/chill:

		chill.py		| Module which take CHiLL annotaions from c file and
					  call CUDA-CHiLL
		README			| This file

	Orio/testsuit/sandbox/chill
	
		axpy4.c			| Classic axpy4 example
		axpy4_simple.c		| Axpy4 example that call an external recipe
		recipe.lua		| Test recipe for axpy4_simple.c
		clean.sh		| Bash file for cleaning

How to run:

	This is a module that allows ORIO call CHiLL. Examples are located at 
	Orio/testsuit/sandbox/chill. To test example run:  orcc -v file.c. This 
	module will create two extra folders:

		- recipes:	all recipes output will be located here
		- outputs:	outputs from recipies will be located here

How to write annotation:

	In this early version we take CHiLL commands as annotation. Where you want
	to test multiple parameters, then type the performance array you want to use.
	See example axpy4.c for an example of tiling.

Other important stuffs

	Be sure to have installed a version of CUDA-CHiLL. CUDA-CHiLL can be downloaded
