CHiLL expansion for ORIO
date: 02/27/2014

Files:

	Orio/orio/module/chill:

		chill.py		| Module which take CHiLL annotaions from c file and
					  call CUDA-CHiLL
		README			| This file

	Orio/testsuit/sandbox/chill/axpy4
	
		axpy4.c			| Classic axpy4 example (WARNING: can cause trouble for now)
		axpy4_simple.c		| Axpy4 example that call an external recipe
		recipe.lua		| Test recipe for axpy4_simple.c
		clean.sh		| Bash file for cleaning

	Orio/testsuit/sandbox/chill/mm
	
		mm.c			| Classic matrix multiply example
		clean.sh		| Bash file for cleaning


	Orio/testsuit/sandbox/chill/tensor-product

		tensor.c		| A tensor product example (Based on nekbone)
		recipe.lua		| Test for only one recipe
		clean.sh		| Bash file for cleaning
		clean-script.py		| A python script for clean output

How to run:

	This is a module that allows ORIO call CHiLL. Examples are located at 
	Orio/testsuit/sandbox/chill. To test example run:  orcc -v file.c. This 
	module will create two extra folders and two extra files:

		- recipes:	  all recipes output will be located here
		- outputs:	  outputs from recipies will be located here
		-_orio_chill_.c:  function created for CHiLL
		-_orio_chill_.h:  Header file for link the CUDA generated files

How to write annotation:

	In this early version we take CHiLL commands as annotation. Where you want
	to test multiple parameters, then type the performance array you want to use.
	See example mm.c for an example which tile and the produce CUDA code. Also make
	sure that linkers for the compilers are in the right path. In the mm.c example
	everything is presented. Also check tensor-product example for an extended example.

Other important stuffs

	Be sure to have installed a version of nvcc (CUDA-Toolkit 5.5 prefered) is installed 
	as well CUDA-CHiLL:

		-CUDA-CHiLL		| http://ctop.cs.utah.edu/downloads/chill.tar.gz
