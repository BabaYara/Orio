This directory contains code that implements scalar replacement
optimizations. It identifies common references to arrays, and then
stores common references in intermediates for future reuse. The place
to create intermediates is somewhere between the loops and determined
by the referenced iterators and loop structure.

Assumptions:
  The variables used in all array references (except the array
  variables) are assumed to be loop indexes (i.e loop iteration
  variables).
