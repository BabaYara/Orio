This directory contains code that implements loop
permutation/interchange. It identifies permutable loops (i.e. loops
that are perfectly nested) then performs permutation based on the
given permutation sequence. it complains if the provided sequence
cannot initiate loop permutation.

Assumptions:
  There is no detection mechanism implemented to detect if a
  permutation is legal. So, the permuted loops might result in
  incorrect code. It's the user's responsibility to know if the
  resulting permutation is legal or not.
